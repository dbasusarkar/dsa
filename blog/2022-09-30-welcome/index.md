This website will always be a work in progress. I am updating it regularly to add more contents and improve its overall quality. If you find any errors or typos, please send me an email (see PGP/GPG Public Key link at the bottom of this page).

<!-- Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory. -->

<!-- Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`. -->

<!-- The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as: -->

<!-- - `2019-05-30-welcome.md` -->
<!-- - `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md` -->

<!-- A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images: -->

<!-- ![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg) -->

<!-- The blog supports tags as well! -->

<!-- **And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config. -->
