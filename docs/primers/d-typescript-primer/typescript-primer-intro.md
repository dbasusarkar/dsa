This page is part of a _**primer series**_ that includes Java, Python, JavaScript (JS), and TypeScript. It is subject to continuous improvement.

TypeScript code eventually gets transformed into JS code through a process called transpilation. Transpilation involves translating a code written in one high-level language into another.
